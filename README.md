# Ionic + Angular Frontend Design: Demo Trading Platform

## How to host the app on a browser

Run this `ionic serve` in the terminal.

The app should be running on the browser at [localhost:8100](http://localhost:8100)

## How to generate the Android APK

### First step - generate an Android file

Run this before doing anything:

`npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli`

Then we need to enable the capacitor by running this in the terminal:

`ionic integrations enable capacitor`

> **BEWARE!** If for some reason it none of these work, and you're a macOS user,
> try putting _sudo_ in front of them.

Moving on, the next step is to run this `ionic build cordova android` in the terminal. <br>
Notice `android` in the line. We are putting it there because we want android. Makes sense.

Now the next thing is to run this line in the terminal: <br>
`ionic cordova platform add android`

The next step is to initialize our app by the following line in terminal: <br>

`npx cap init [appName] [appId]`

where the `[appName]` should be the actual name of the app, for eg. "tradingApp", <br>
and the `[appId]` is the domain identifier of your app `(ex: com.tradingApp.app)`.

The next thing to do is to run `ionic build` in the terminal. This generates <br>
a `www` file, so don't touch it.

> If you're a macOS user, put _sudo_ in front of it in case it doesn't work.

Going forward, the next thing to do is to write `npx cap add android` <br>
and this will generate the native android file ready to be used in Android Studio for eg.

And last but not least, we run `npx cap open android`. <br>
Now if you have Android Studio installed on your computer, it will open it up for you. <br>
If not, go and install Android studio and try this line again.

### Second step - Generating an APK in Android Studio for Android devices

In Android Studio, in the _Build_ tab, click on _Generate Signed Bundle / APK..._

It will open up a window making you choose between two radio points, <br>
and here you will select the _APK_ option. <br>

Then you will see a bunch of form inputs, so you need to go ahead and fill them all out.<br>

After filling them up, click on Next.

Now you have two more options before finishing it all up and that is to choose between <br>
_release_ or _debug_.

Select release, then tick both of the checkboxes before clicking on Finish.

It will then proceed to build the APK file for you.

The APK file should be generated in the same file the Android Studio is reading the scripts from.
To be more specific, the filepath should look something like this:

android -> app -> build -> release -> APP.apk
